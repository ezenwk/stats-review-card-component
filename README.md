### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS preprocessor
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- I learnt Git and SASS this week and decided to put myself to a test. During this Frontend Mentor challenge, I utilized SASS variables, mixins and general SASS syntax in the solution to this challenge. Oh yeah, trying to get used to pushing to Git :)
